  In 2013, Kohli was ranked number one in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen. In
  2018, he was ranked top Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer to
  hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. He is the first
  player to score 20,000 runs in a decade. His cover drives are just awesome.
