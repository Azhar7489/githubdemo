  Social media outlets differ from traditional media (e.g. print magazines and
  newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality,[12]
  reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.[13] Additionally,
  social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (i.e., many
  sources to many receivers) while traditional media outlets operate under a
  monologic transmission model (i.e., one source to many receivers). For
  instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station
  broadcasts the same programs to an entire city.[14]
