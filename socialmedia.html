  Social media outlets differ from traditional media (e.g. print magazines and
  newspapers, TV, and radio broadcasting) in many ways, including quality,[12]
  reach, frequency, usability, relevancy, and permanence.[13] Additionally,
  social media outlets operate in a dialogic transmission system (i.e., many
  sources to many receivers) while traditional media outlets operate under a
  monologic transmission model (i.e., one source to many receivers). For
  instance, a newspaper is delivered to many subscribers, and a radio station
  broadcasts the same programs to an entire city.[14] 
  
  Users usually access social media services through web-based apps on desktops or download services
  that offer social media functionality to their mobile devices (e.g.
  smartphones and tablets). As users engage with these electronic services, they
  create highly interactive platforms in which individuals, communities, and
  organizations can share, co-create, discuss, participate, and modify
  user-generated or self-curated content posted online.[9][7][1] Additionally,
  social media are used to document memories, learn about and explore things,
  advertise oneself, and form friendships along with the growth of ideas from
  the creation of blogs, podcasts, videos, and gaming sites.[10] This changing
  relationship between humans and technology is the focus of the emerging field
  of technological self-studies.[11] Some of the most popular social media
  websites, with more than 100 million registered users, include Twitter,
  Facebook (and its associated Messenger), WeChat, ShareChat, Instagram (and its
  associated app Threads), QZone, Weibo, VK, Tumblr, Baidu Tieba, and LinkedIn.
  Depending on interpretation, other popular platforms that are sometimes
  referred to as social media services include YouTube, Letterboxd, QQ, Quora,
  Telegram, WhatsApp, Signal, LINE, Snapchat, Pinterest, Viber, Reddit, Discord,
  TikTok, Microsoft Teams, and more. Wikis are examples of collaborative content
  creation.
